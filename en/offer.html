            <h1>Our Offer</h1>
            <h2>
                <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> All our products are fully responsive, which means they are easily readable and they
                look well on any device, whether it is a PC, laptot, tablet or smartphone.</h2>

                <h2>New Website</h2>
                <img src="../img/construction.jpg" alt="website construction with cranes" width="500px">
                <p>We can create a new website from scratch, and we always work to fulfil a Customer's expectations and actual
                    needs. Already at the beginning of the process, we suggest the best possible "system" in which the website
                    should be built. There are many techniques (or frameworks) for constructing effective websites. If a
                    Customer's goal is to create the company image and he or she foresees just a few necessary updates per
                    year, we will use the wppropriate framework. And a completely different one, if the website is to engage
                    the viewer, include a call for action, and the firm would want to keep updating the web content on its
                    own, and on a daily basis.
                    <br>Price: from USD 300.</p>
                <h2>Redevelopment of an Existing Website</h2>
                <img src="../img/coding.jpg" alt="a screen with many lines of code" width="500px">
                <p>Many companies have websites created a while ago when there was no resposiveness issue. So, the sites still
                    look excellent on a large screen of a PC or laptop, but they are completely illegible on a tablet or
                    smartphone. And today it almost means the websites are not out there. 80% of the Internet traffic is
                    genrated by mobile devices.
                    <br>Cena: from USD 200.</p>
                <h2>Localization of New and Existing Websites</h2>
                <img src="../img/localization.jpg" alt="birds like ideas flying between trees shaped like human heads" width="500px">
                <p>In our global village, the presence of a company in the distant locations perhaps not always brings the immediate
                    results, however, in the long run, it will pay off. But to be effective, providing a translation into
                    the local language is not good enough. Such a website must be hand tailored to the local conditions,
                    customer expectations, traditions, and effective marketing techniques. And all this should be packed
                    in a graphic design adjusted to the local taste. Such whole package means the localization, and our
                    partners all over the world will be happy to implement it for you.
                    <br>Price: negotiated per project.</p>
                <h2>SEO, Positioning, and Advertising</h2>
                <img src="../img/omarketing.jpg" alt="a man presenting a tablet screen with the online marketing plan" width="500px">
                <p>All our websites, both, the new and the upgraded, are optimized for the major search engines with no additional
                    fees. Search engines positioning and avertising campaigns must be carefully planned with a Customer,
                    and they are based on a detailed marketing plan. We are prepared to cooperate with you on this and implement
                    your ideas worldwide.
                    <br>Price: negotiated per project.</p>
