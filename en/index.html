                <h2>Progress</h2>
                <p>As the progress in technology continues to speed up, companies are under pressure to keep up. Just to remain
                    competitive, and to keep moving forward. There is no way around it.</p>
                <img src="../img/progress.jpg" alt="progress, modern warehouse" width="500px">
                <h2>Internet</h2>
                <p>More and more important for all industries and services becomes their strong presence on the Internet. And
                    the key word here is responsiveness. Not only in the narrow sense of being able to present the web content
                    on all kinds of devices, desktops tablets, and smartphones. The clue of responsiveness is to be able to
                    quickly respond to the ever changing globalized market.</p>

                <h2>Small and Medium Firms</h2>
                <p>While the large corporations can spend significant amounts of money to always stay on top of events, small
                    and medium sized firms are often at a disadvantage. They cannot afford to maintain their own teams responsible
                    for keeping up with what is happening on the web. And often they are considered too small accounts for
                    the large, professional firms specialized in this area. Here is where we come.</p>
