HTML5 structure for a web development services website



1. The project includes English and Polish versions, which are identically structured in HTML5, however the Polish text tends to be longer, which may affect the final rendering.


2. The English language HTML is contained in the folder called "en" and you work on this version.


3. All files internally linked.


4. All photos are licensed and placed (in large resolutions and sizes) in the folder img.


5. I have restricted the width of all photos to 500px, only to make it more organized. Whether all the photos will be used, and what size they will eventually be, is up to the dveloper.


6. In general I prefer simple and pastel color schemes, even close to monochromatic. But I am open for other solutions as long as they offer solid and elegant final impression. Please take under consideration that the comany logo look generally better on a dark background.


7. In the showcase I would count on a few samples of fancy looking headers an footers. If you see it feasible, I would be happy if you added a few of you best websites as well. But if not, only my own websites will need to be included: http://dom.czerminek.pl/ (not responsive), https://jbt.translateme.com.pl/ (this one needs a bit of reworking as it does not display well on tablets and larger smartphones), https://film.edu.pl/, http://akitatranslations.com/;

8. In case of any questions, please write to: jbtprofit@gmail.com and I will answer within 12 hours at latest.
